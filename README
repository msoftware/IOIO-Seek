IOIO / Android project.

V2.0 Details:

Fixed signature issue.  Added support for multiple threads.  
App now controls four servos, three analog inputs, and two simple digital outs.

General Details:

Specialized app that implements several digital outputs and analog inputs to Android 
via IOIO breakout board.  As coded, app provides control of four servos and several 
LEDs via digital output, and reads three solar panels' inputs via an analog.  
Consider this a proof of concept per se.  

Of note:  this app requires an IOIO board to fire.  
UI will appear locked unless IOIO is detected via USB.  

App acts as front end for several pin interfaces.  Setup is:

Android Item | IOIO Location | UsageInitial upload. 

Slider Bar 1 | Pin 10 | PWM Output, 0 - 180 degrees 
Slider Bar 2 | Pin 11 | PWM Output, 0 - 180 degrees 
Slider Bar 3 | Pin 12 | PWM Output, 0 - 180 degrees 
Slider Bar 4 | Pin 13 | PWM Output, 0 - 180 degrees 

Digital Out 1 | Pin 25 | Pure Digital output, 0V or 3.3V
Digital Out 2 | Pin 26 | Pure Digital output, 0V or 3.3V

Analog Read 1 | Pin 40 | Analog input, scaled 0 to 1
Analog Read 2 | Pin 41 | Analog input, scaled 0 to 1
Analog Read 3 | Pin 42 | Analog input, scaled 0 to 1

Requires:

Android device (tested on Droid 2 w/ Froyo)
IOIO development board
Servo motor (up to 4)
Solar Panels (or similar source of analog input)
LEDs (or similar device rated for 3.3V)
